# 👋 Hi, I’m Phat Nguyen (pnt325)

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile!

I’m an **Embedded Firmware & Software Engineer** with **8+ years of experience** building products across **hardware, firmware, desktop, and mobile platforms**. My work covers the **entire product lifecycle** — from prototype to production and deployment.

I have hands-on experience in **hardware design (schematic & PCB)**, **embedded systems**, **desktop and mobile applications**, and **cloud-connected IoT devices**.  
Currently, I work full-time on **freelance and contract projects**, helping teams design, develop, and ship reliable embedded products.

I maintain a **home development lab** with professional tools for debugging, testing, and validation. I also collaborate with and manage cross-functional teams including **firmware/software, hardware, and mechanical engineers** to deliver complete embedded solutions.
